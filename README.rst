Packagebot Readme
=================

Packagebot is a project I started to create a Mediawiki bot that will read the
the package and category metadata from the portage tree in Funtoo and use that
information to update or create category and package pages on the wiki.

The focus is to be generic to any wiki installation and any portage tree, but
the bot is definitely created with Funtoo's wiki and portage tree as priority.

Status
======

Packagebot is only just starting. It is far from complete and only manages to
walk a portage tree finding metadata and reading in that metadata through an
incompletely implemented SAX-style parser.

Feedback
========

Feedback is certainly welcome. Please send feedback to brant@gurganus.name.
